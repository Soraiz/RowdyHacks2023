Repository for codes and project for RowdyHacks 2023


Project: Python script to collect SHA625 hash files from a file or directory's contents, and upload them to TotalVirus. 
            After uploading the results into TotalVirus, web scrap the results into the python script. 
            
This repository consists of three python scripts that were intended to work together:
            one was to collect all the hashes of the specified file or file
            the second one was to upload those hashes to VirusTotal using their API Key and request the results to be shown in the command prompt
            the third one was supposed to be a python script to output the results of both scripts in it, like an application
